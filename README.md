AI-Driven Cancer Treatment Decision Simulator (Tic-Tac-Toe based)

# AI-Driven Cancer Treatment Decision Simulator

This project is an innovative Python simulator designed as a coursework assignment to help clinicians train in developing better cancer treatment strategies. Using the familiar Tic-Tac-Toe framework as an analogy, this AI-driven tool represents the dynamic and challenging decision-making process involved in real-world cancer treatment planning.

## Project Concept

- **Player's moves:** Symbolise various treatment options chosen by a clinician.
- **AI opponent:** Represents the unpredictable and adaptive challenges posed by cancer cells.
- **Game board:** Acts as a virtual environment where strategies are tested in turn-based interactions.


## Features

- Creates a 3x3 decision grid inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Accepts player input to simulate treatment choices.
- Implements an AI opponent that reacts dynamically to the player's strategy.
- Checks for win/tie states to simulate successful or failed treatment outcomes.
- Displays the updated board after each move, maintaining clear and engaging output.
- Well-structured, modular Python code with detailed comments for easy understanding.

## What I Learned

- Structuring clear and reusable Python functions for simulation logic.
- Managing decision trees and state-checking algorithms.
- Communicating complex ideas through an intuitive simulation.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Achievement

- Awarded a **78%** (high first-class) with exceptional feedback for creativity, code structure, and the novel approach to modeling a medical decision problem.
